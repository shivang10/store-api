# Store API
Here we have populated our database with a fake data. There is only one API in this that helps you to perform all the search, filter, sorting and pagination queries. This is particularly useful when user wants to perform a query according to their needs. All the queries are performed at the database end. An aggregation pipeline is created which then returns the data accordingly.
